# 📦 Supply Chain & Inventory Analytics (Slooze Challenge)

An end-to-end data analytics project focused on optimizing supply chain operations, forecasting demand, and managing inventory efficiently.

## 📊 Project Overview
This notebook processes the Slooze Challenge dataset to extract actionable business insights across five key domains:
1. **Demand Forecasting:** Utilized Meta's Prophet library for time-series forecasting to predict future 30-day product demand.
2. **ABC Analysis:** Applied the Pareto Principle to classify inventory into high (A), moderate (B), and low (C) priority tiers.
3. **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):** Calculated the optimal order sizes to minimize holding and ordering costs.
4. **Reorder Point (ROP) Analysis:** Determined exact inventory thresholds for reordering, factoring in safety stock and lead times.
5. **Lead Time Analysis:** Assessed supplier efficiency by analyzing procurement timelines.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `prophet`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* **Data Retrieval:** `kagglehub`
